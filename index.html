        <p>Do you like the creamy taste and the sugary topping? Do you dream of donuts when you sleep?
          <br>If you do, you don't know the <span class="italic">secret</span> that donuts try to hide from you.
          <br>Donuts have proven time and time again that they are not what they seem.
          <br>They watch at us night. They steal our things when we sleep. They give us nightmares. They are <span>NOT</span> our friends like they make it seem. They LIE!!</p>

        <h3>BEHOLD THE SECRET</h3>
        <p>Donuts work for a secret organization that the average eye does not see. They are the evil in our lives that we must remove!!

          <p>
            In order to see this evil, we must look closer at the situation.
            <br> Here is a glimpse of the truth:</p>
          <div id="par1">
            <p>Donut = Doughnut
              <br> The word Doughnut has 8 letters
              <br> The word sprinkle also has 8 letters
              <br> Sprinkles are put on Ice cream
              <br> Ice cream = Ice cream cake
              <br> Frosting is put on cake
              <br> Frosting = Rainbow frosting
              <br> Rainbow frosting has the Letter "R"
              <br>
            </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <div id="par2">
            <p>Bay Ridge also has the letter "R"
              <br> Do you know what else has the letter R?
              <br> That is right, The word rock has the letter R
              <br> Rocks are round
              <br> Do you know what else is round?
              <br> Donuts are round
              </br>Donuts also have a round hole in the center
              <br> In the picture below, an eye looks through the hole
              <br>

          <p>Eyeballs are round
            <br> Eyes can look a'round'
            <br> When eyes look around, they can see shapes
            <br> A circle is a shape
            <br> Circles are also round
            <br> The word 'round' starts with the letter R</p>
